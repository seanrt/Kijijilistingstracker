# Kijijilistingstracker
This python3 script grabs Kijiji listings containing given key words and outputs the new listings. There is a desktop version and an android version. Currently I'm using the android version with QPython3.

Things to work on:
1) The android version needs to be able to push notifications of new listings to the phone.
